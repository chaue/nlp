# Natural Language Processing Optimization Project

This project aims to optimize a maximum entropy function used in areas of natural language processing such as word prediction or translation.
Libraries I will be using include Numpy and NLTK, a collection of libraries and programs that aid in processing language data. 

Done under the guidance of Prof. Sylvester Eriksson-Bique of UCLA
